      As a principal engineer I helped design, implement, and maintain
      infrastructure and REST APIs for systems that helped deliver the user
      experience platform which all other teams at the company relied upon. This
      was done using a Javascript and TypeScript tech stack.

      I played a vital role in migrating all systems into AWS and Kubernetes
      using docker and helm following industry recommended security and best
      practices. Deployments were fully CICD driven with Jenkins and github
      actions. I lead setting up application and cluster monitoring, logging
      solutions, performance metrics, and various dashboards. I wrote
      documentation and mentored other developers on the team.

      In addition I worked with a small team that built and maintained the UI
      and APIs for tools used company-wide for storing application
      configuration, data driven customer recommendations, and A/B
      experimentation settings. This was implemented with a nodejs and React
      tech stack.

      Worked on the UX team building shared user interface components originally
      in jQuery and then later with React and React Native. I built highly
      performant APIs using nodejs streams that delivered shared header and
      navigation across all applications at the company, interfaced with the
      translation team, and managed infrastructure and deployments. As a
      mission-critical application, it was designed with many layers of
      redundancy and caching.

      I lead and managed a small team that built the "My Account" application
      using nodejs and Ember, used by over 10 million customers. I also helped
      implement and lead the customer authentication delegation experience
      alongside the auth and security teams.

      Prior that I built the shared web hosting file manager application
      front-end using Javascript and nodejs, while working closely with
      developers building the Java based backend API.

      At Go Daddy I worked with a small agile team on the Easy Database for
      Websites product doing front-end development using JavaScript, PHP, HTML,
      and CSS. EZDB was a simple database application that allowed users to
      define and manage data and easily embed widgets onto their website. When I
      came on board I helped to improve the code quality and bring the user
      interface in line with user experience designs and standards. I introduced
      JavaScript unit tests and added progressive enhancement using the latest
      CSS3 and HTML5 technologies. Some examples are HTML5 drag-and-drop file
      uploading, localStorage for UI preferences, and CSS3 for UI elements that
      traditionally would've needed multiple sliced images. I also designed and
      documented a CSS interface to allow customers unlimited customization of
      their widgets and provided assistance in the forum.

      I worked remotely with developers at the Irvine, CA branch. We built a
      corporate wide customer management and sales application using Ruby on
      Rails. Besides working to design the UI and develop the application, I
      also built the infrastructure for the production systems. I continued to
      maintain internal Perl applications, and as the company grew I was a vital
      asset in integration projects with Salesforce.com, Great Plains billing,
      and other software. I introduced subversion for source control, Trac for
      project management, and other best practices.

      Working closely with the Engineering department, my primary role was
      internal application development. New applications were designed and
      written for managing datacenter assets, tracking IP space, interfacing
      with network equipment, usage tracking, account provisioning, and more.
      All were written using Object Oriented Perl, mod_perl, MySQL database, and
      were well tested, and documented. I also continued to maintain the
      existing helpdesk software, write scripts to help with the system
      administration tasks, and provide statistical reports. In addition I also
      provided escalated support for systems and network related problems as
      part Engineering.

      When Data393 acquired E-com Media Group, I transferred to that division to
      better utilize my skill set. I worked with a team of other developers and
      designers where I introduced source control with CVS and other software
      development best practices. Our primary task was designing and developing
      a new version of the company’s e-commerce, content management, sales, and
      customer management tool. We used mod_perl, MySQL, and utilized load
      balancing. I lead development of the e-commerce module and web service
      APIs. I also built customer frontend e-commerce websites.

      I also used ASP and MS SQL to develop custom applications for customers
      and maintain the old version of the company’s flagship product. Using my
      previous experience I helped design and develop a new helpdesk and
      customer portal for Data393.

      I developed modular and reusable OO Perl code including documentation and
      test suites for in house applications used in the billing and web hosting
      environments. I installed, configured, and maintained the corporate CVS
      server for source control as well as wrote documentation for software
      development and source control guidelines.

      I maintained the Perl helpdesk software by fixing bugs. I increased staff
      efficiency by adding new features and performing profiling to optimize the
      code and database for a 1,000% speed increase. Other tasks were writing
      various reports for the support, billing, and hosting environments as well
      as writing the order system and automated provisioning processes.

      On a contract basis I developed CGI applications using Perl and MySQL. I
