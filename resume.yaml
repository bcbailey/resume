      At Go Daddy I worked with a small agile team on the Easy Database for
      Websites product doing front-end development using JavaScript, PHP, HTML,
      and CSS. EZDB is a simple database application that allows users to define
      and manage data and easily embed widgets onto their website. When I came
      on board I helped to improve the code quality and bring the user interface
      in line with user experience designs and standards. I introduced
      JavaScript unit tests and added progressive enhancement using the latest
      CSS3 and HTML5 technologies. Some examples are HTML5 drag-and-drop file
      uploading, localStorage for UI preferences, and CSS3 for UI elements that
      traditionally would’ve needed multiple sliced images. I also designed and
      documented a CSS interface to allow customers unlimited customization of
      their widgets and provided assistance in the forum.

      After Data393 was acquired by Latisys, I worked remotely with the
      development team from the Irvine, CA branch. I introduced subversion for
      source control, Trac for project management, and other best practices. We
      built a corporate wide customer management and sales application using
      Ruby on Rails. Besides working to design the UI and develop the
      application, I also configured and maintained the production systems. I
      continued to maintain internal Perl applications, and as the company grew
      I was a vital asset in integration projects with Salesforce.com, Great
      Plains, and others.

      Working closely with the Engineering department, my primary role was
      internal application development. New applications were designed and
      written for managing datacenter assets, tracking IP space, interfacing
      with network equipment, usage tracking, account provisioning, and more.
      All were written using Object Oriented Perl, mod_perl, MySQL database, and
      were well tested, and documented. I also continued to maintain the
      existing helpdesk software, write scripts to help with the system
      administration tasks, and provide statistical reports. In addition I also
      provided escalated support for systems and network related problems as
      part Engineering.

      When Data393 acquired E-com Media Group, I transferred to that division to
      better utilize my skill set. I worked with a team of other developers and
      designers where I introduced source control with CVS and other software
      development best practices. Our primary task was designing and developing
      a new version of the company’s e-commerce, content management, sales, and
      customer management tool. We used mod_perl, MySQL, and utilized load
      balancing. I lead development of the e-commerce module and web service
      APIs. I also built customer frontend e-commerce websites.
      
      I also used ASP and MS SQL to develop custom applications for customers
      and maintain the old version of the company’s flagship product. Using my
      previous experience I helped design and develop a new helpdesk and
      customer portal for Data393.

      I developed modular and reusable OO Perl code including documentation and
      test suites for in house applications used in the billing and web hosting
      environments. I installed, configured, and maintained the corporate CVS
      server for source control as well as wrote documentation for software
      development and source control guidelines.

      I maintained the Perl helpdesk software by fixing bugs. I increased staff
      efficiency by adding new features and performing profiling to optimize the
      code and database for a 1,000% speed increase. Other tasks were writing
      various reports for the support, billing, and hosting environments as well
      as writing the order system and automated provisioning processes.

      Managed and supported server software such as Apache, BIND, Exim, and
